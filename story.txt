Once there was a monkey and a crocodile, and the monkey used to live on a grape tree, and one day the monkey gave some grapes to the crocodile. The crocodile gave the grapes to his wife.
The grapes were very sweet and the crocodile's wife told him that if the monkey eats them everyday, how sweet must his heart be, and she asked him to bring him home.
The crocodile brought the monkey, and in mid-way he told moneky that they were going to eat his heart and the monkey told him that he forgot his heart on the tree so they must go back to bring it. Then they went back and the monkey quickly climed the tree.
